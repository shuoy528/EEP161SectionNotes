# Data Wrangling

## Tidyverse Grammar

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# this should display the homepage of the documentation for tidyverse
?tidyverse
```

```{r}
# Set your working directory
setwd("C:/Users/shuoy/Dropbox/161/Sections/Section2")

# Example: Read egg price data.
df <- read.csv("DailyPrices.csv")
```

We can check first several rows by using `head`. 
```{r}
head(df)
```

If you want to see all rows and columns, use `View()` or click the object in the environment pane.
```{r}
View(df)
```

We can do a quick summary of data by using `summary`.
```{r}
summary(df)
```

**Question:** What are the observations/units in the data? What are the variables?

This dataframe is in "tidy" form. This means that **each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each cell is a single value.**

The `tidyverse` package that we installed earlier provides useful functions for transforming tidy data. In this section we will cover commonly used functions from the `tidyverse` package. Each of these commands work in a similar way.

-   the first input is a tidy dataframe

-   they output a new dataframe

-   they can be "chained" together with piping - this means that the output of a function becomes the input of the next function

## dplyr: Selecting Columns with `select()`

The `select()` function is used to choose specific columns in a data frame. 
- Use the colon operator `:` to select a range of variables.
- Use the exclamation mark `!` or `-` to exclude variables from a selection.
- Use `&` for intersection (common variables between sets).
- Use `|` for union (all variables across sets).
- Use c() to combine multiple selections.

It supports helper functions for selecting columns based on patterns.Useful helpers include:

- `everything()`: Moves specified columns to the beginning, retaining others in order (e.g., select(df, a, everything())).
- `starts_with()` / `ends_with()`: Selects columns by prefix or suffix.
- `contains()`: Matches columns containing a substring.
- `matches()`: Uses regular expressions for flexible pattern matching.

Notes: 
- In R, functions working on data-frames are transitory: if you don't *save* the result, it just prints it.
- You do not need to put quotation marks around the variable names. This is a convenient feature of all `tidyverse` functions.

```{r}
selected_df <- df %>%
  select(Date, Low.Price, High.Price)
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>% 
  select(Date:High.Price)
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>% 
  select(!c(Low.Price, High.Price))
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>%
  select(-Low.Price, -High.Price)
colnames(selected_df)

reordered_df <- df %>%
  select(Low.Price, everything())
colnames(reordered_df)

selected_df <- df %>%
  select(starts_with("D"))
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>%
  select(ends_with("e"))
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>%
  select(contains("Price"))
colnames(selected_df)

selected_df <- df %>%
  select(matches("^L.+e$")) # Regular expressions
colnames(selected_df)
```

## Filtering Rows with `filter()`

The `filter()` function is used to select rows based on logical conditions.
```{r}
# Filter rows where `Low.Price` equals 171
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(Low.Price == 171)
summary(df_filtered)

# Exclude rows where `Market.Name` is "CALIFORNIA"
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(Market.Name != "CALIFORNIA")
table(df_filtered$Market.Name)

# Filter rows where `Egg.Class` matches "LARGE" or "JUMBO"
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(Egg.Class %in% c("LARGE", "JUMBO"))
table(df_filtered$Egg.Class)

# Filter rows with multiple conditions (AND condition)
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(Low.Price >= 200 & High.Price <= 200)
summary(df_filtered)

# Filter rows with multiple conditions (OR condition)
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(Low.Price >= 200 | High.Price <= 200)
summary(df_filtered)

# Exclude rows with missing values in `Mostly.Low`
df_filtered <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Mostly.Low))
summary(df_filtered)
```

**Question** The original dataframe `df` contains 42,702 rows and 10 columns. If we select the variables `Date`, `Market.Name`, `Egg.Class`, `Low.Price`, and `High.Price` and filter the rows where `Egg.Class` is either "LARGE" or "JUMBO," how many rows and columns will remain in the resulting dataframe?

```{r}
df_filtered <- df %>%
  select(Date, Market.Name, Egg.Class, Low.Price, High.Price) %>%
  filter(Egg.Class %in% c("LARGE", "JUMBO"))

dim(df)

dim(df_filtered)
```
**Question:** what are some ways we could check that we have filtered down to the correct observations? 

```{r}
# Hint: `summary()` is a useful function for checking the range of values of a continous variable.

df_filtered <- df %>% 
  select(Date, Market.Name, Egg.Class, Low.Price, High.Price) %>%
  filter(Market.Name != "CALIFORNIA" & Low.Price >= 200 & High.Price <= 300)

# Check price range
summary(df_filtered)

# Check the count of each market
table(df_filtered$Market.Name)
```

## Adding or Changing Columns with `mutate()`

The mutate() function adds new columns or modifies existing ones.
```{r}
# Applying multiple mutate() operations
df_new <- df %>% 
  select(Date, Market.Name, Low.Price, High.Price) %>%
  mutate(Avg.Price = (Low.Price + High.Price) / 2, 
         Price.Group= cut(Avg.Price, c(0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000)),
         High.Price.Flag = if_else(Low.Price > 150, "Above 150", "Below 150"))

unique(df_new$Price.Group)

head(df_new)
```
## Sorting Data with `arrange()`

The `arrange()` function sorts rows in a data frame. Use it to reorder data by one or more columns, either in ascending or descending order.

```{r}
# Sort data by a single column (ascending order by default)
df_arrange <- df %>%
  arrange(Low.Price)
head(df_arrange)

# Sort data in descending order
df_arrange <- df %>%
  arrange(desc(Low.Price))
head(df_arrange)

# Sort by multiple columns
df_arrange <- df %>%
  arrange(Market.Name, desc(Low.Price))
head(df_arrange)

# Challenge: Handling missing values (place them at the end)
df_arrange <- df %>%
  arrange(desc(!is.na(Low.Price)), Low.Price)
head(df_arrange)
```

## Grouping data with `group_by()`

The `group_by` operation is a powerful and flexible tool used in data analysis to split data into groups based on some criteria, perform computations on each group, and then combine the results into a summary form. The diagram below illustrates the general steps.

![](C:/Users/shuoy/Dropbox/161/Sections/Section2/Groupby.png)
```{r}
# save the same dataframe but grouped by race
df_group <- df %>%
  group_by(Market.Name)

glimpse(df_group)

group_keys(df_group)
```

## Summarizing Data with `summarize()`

The `summarize()` function creates summary statistics. Use it with `group_by()` for group-level summaries.

```{r}
# Compute the average miles per gallon
df_summarize <- df %>%
  summarize(avg_low_price = mean(Low.Price))
df_summarize

# Challenge: Missing values
df_summarize <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Low.Price)) %>%
  summarize(avg_low_price = mean(Low.Price))
df_summarize

# Summarize by group
df_summarize <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(Low.Price)) %>%
  group_by(Market.Name) %>%
  summarize(avg_low_price = mean(Low.Price), count = n())
df_summarize

```

## Practice

Starting with the original tidy dataset, perform the following calculations for each market:

- Calculate the average low price for eggs classified as "EXTRA LARGE."

- Calculate the proportion of "LARGE" eggs with High.Price ranging between 200 and 500.

```{r}

extra_large_avg <- df %>%
  group_by(Market.Name) %>%
  filter(Egg.Class == "EXTRA LARGE") %>%
  summarize(Average.Low.Price = mean(Low.Price, na.rm = TRUE))
print(extra_large_avg)

large_egg_prop <- df %>%
  filter(Egg.Class == "LARGE") %>%
  group_by(Market.Name) %>%
  summarize(
    Proportion = sum(High.Price >= 200 & High.Price <= 500, na.rm = TRUE) / n()
  )
print(large_egg_prop)

```

# Data Visualization

The most common set of tools for creating plots in R is `ggplot2`, which we will use throughout this course.

In late 2022, egg prices quintupled due to a severe outbreak of avian flu (H5N1), which led to the culling of millions of chickens and significantly reduced the supply of eggs. A similar situation is unfolding now, with California wholesale egg prices surpassing their 2022 peak (unadjusted for inflation). For more details, refer to the blog [Eggflation Returns with a Vengeance](https://agdatanews.substack.com/p/more-than-half-of-californias-dairy?r=i2qe&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true). Let's replicate the first figure from the blog here.

```{r}
df$Date <- as.Date(df$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

start_date <- as.Date("2019-01-01")

## Plot prices
plot_prices <- df %>%
  arrange(Date) %>%
  filter(Date>=start_date) %>%
  filter(Egg.Class %in% c("LARGE")) %>%
  filter(Market.Name %in% c("CALIFORNIA","IOWA-MINNESOTA-WISCONSIN")) %>%
  mutate(Market.Name=str_to_title(
  ifelse(Market.Name=="IOWA-MINNESOTA-WISCONSIN","Midwest",Market.Name))) %>%
  mutate(Price=(Low.Price+High.Price)/2) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x=Date,
      y=Price,
      color=factor(Market.Name, levels=c("California","Midwest")))) +
  geom_line(linewidth=1) +
  labs(x = "", 
       y="Cents per Dozen", 
       color="State", 
       caption="Source: https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/py-report-config?category=Egg\n https://agdatanews.substack.com") +
  ggtitle("Wholesale Large Egg Prices")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size=16), text = element_text(size=12))

# draw and save plot
plot_prices
ggsave(paste0("daily_egg_prices_2024_",start_date,".png"),bg="white") 
```
